# Dominant-Color-Extraction-UnsupervisedML
In this project an automated dominant color extraction method using clustering models (K-means, K-medoids clustering) is proposed and implemented. The functions in the jupyter file can be used as a mini toolbox to help anyone who might be interested in color extraction and/or quantification of colors in an image. Possible uses of the functions in the notebook include assistance in: marketing analysis, semiotics, sociology of colors, automatic creation of movie scene timestamps and artistic projects.
